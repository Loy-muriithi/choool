            <h3>Muvuti boys high school</h3>
            <p>Muvuti High School is one of Kenyaâ€™s National Schools located in machakos, along kitui Road,500M off machakos
            -Nairobi Highway. It borders machokos State House to the East. The school was founded in 1927 as Francis Scott High School
            but later renamed to Muvuti High School after Kenya attained independence in 1963.</p>

            <p>The first stone was laid by the then colonial governor Edward William Macleay Grigg. It has roughly 200 acres of land at
            the foothills of Menengai Crater. Initially the co-educational institution was reserved for children of the whites who
            lived in the outlying farming areas and British administrators. All teachers, masters (as they were called at the time)
            were also white. First formed as a boarding school, it still allowed day bergs on condition that they lived around the
            school.</p>
            <p>By the late 1950s, the school had grown to have a swimming pool, numerous rugby pitches, basketball courts, football
            pitches, hockey and cricket fields. The school also had well equipped learning resources. It had fully furbished
            classrooms, and science laboratories. Unique was the weather station where geography students took practical lessons. To
            keep up with its fast pace of growth, a large contingent of residential subordinate staff was employed.</p>
